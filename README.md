## DAY 2
### Analyzing World Happiness Report 2020 with Power BI


### Steps Taken:

### 1. Loading the Dataset:
- Utilized Power BI's "Get Data from Web" option to load the World Happiness Report 2020 dataset.
- Spent time understanding the dataset and its variables.

### 2. Visual 1: GDP per Capita across Countries
- Utilized drag-and-drop feature to plot GDP per capita against countries.
- Adjusted bubble sizes for better visual representation.

### 3. Visual 2: Relationship between Freedom to make life choices and Healthy Life Expectancy
- Used a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between freedom to make life choices and healthy life expectancy.
- Initially, only one point was displayed due to summarization. Resolved by adding the country column to the values field.

### 4. Visual 3: Relationship between GDP per Capita and Perceptions of Corruption
- Employed another scatter plot to investigate the relationship between GDP per capita and perception of corruption.
- Disabled summarization under x and y-axis fields.

### 5. Visual 4: Clustering GDP per Capita and Generosity
- Utilized a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis and generosity on the y-axis.
- Applied the "automatically find clusters" option to automate the clustering process.
- Performed color formatting and brushing for enhanced visualization.

    4. Utilized features of the magnifying glass visual option for further analysis, such as average line, series, line, and data labels.

### Slicers: Controlling Visualization Based on Product and Segment
- **Objective**: Control visualizations based on specific product and segment criteria.
- **Steps**:
    1. Used slicers to interactively filter data.
    2. For the first slicer, added the "Product" column to the field section and configured it to single select mode using slicer settings.
    3. Added the "Segment" column to the field section for the second slicer, applied horizontal orientation, and enabled the "show select all" option for better visual presentation.
    4. For the third slicer, added the "Units Sold" column to the field section.
